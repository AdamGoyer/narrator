## Want to make your own AI app?
Check out [Replicate](https://replicate.com). We make it easy to run machine learning models with an API.

## Setup

Clone this repo, and setup and activate a virtualenv:

```bash
python3 -m pip install virtualenv
python3 -m virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install the dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Make a [Replicate](https://replicate.com), OpenAI, and [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) account and set your tokens:

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<token>
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=<eleven-token>
```

Make a new voice in Eleven and get the voice id of that voice using their [get voices](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/voices) API.

## Run it!

```bash
python capture.py
```
In one terminal. In the other, run the narrator:

```bash
python narrator.py
```
